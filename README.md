## Record

#### Description:

The project is a clone of a book called 1000 record covers. The book is divided into decades, 60’s to 90’s and showcases a collection of famous or interesting cover artworks. I am a collector of vinyls and have always been fascinated with the artwork that many vinyl record covers have. I thought that it would be a fun project to make a digital version of the book.

The project showcases vinyl covers from different decades and different artists/bands. Users can browse through the collection and filter by artist/band or decade, and also read about music history of the decades.
